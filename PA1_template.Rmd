## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r load_and_preprocess}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r dialy_steps, message=FALSE}
library(sqldf)
daily_steps <- sqldf("select date, sum(steps) total_steps from activity where steps != 'NA' and date != 'NA' group by date order by date")
daily_steps
hist(daily_steps$total_steps,  breaks = 10 ,col="red", xlab = "Total Daily Steps", main = "Histogram of Total Daily Steps")

```

```{r dialy_steps_2, message=FALSE}
# library(plyr)
# activity_2 <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
# daily_steps_2 <- ddply(activity_2, c("date"), summarise, total_steps = sum(steps))
# daily_steps_2
# hist(daily_steps_2$total_steps,  breaks = 10 ,col="red", xlab = "Total Daily Steps", main = "Histogram of Total Daily Steps")

```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
